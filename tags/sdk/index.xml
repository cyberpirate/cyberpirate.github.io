      <description>Goal This SDK is designed to enable developers to interact with the Voice Recognition iSpeech API using Javascript.
Implementation The SDK uses getUserMedia() to record audio from the browser, encodes it to speex, then streams the data to the iSpeech API using a WebSocket.
Completed This project completed the stated goals.
My contribution I developed and maintained this project through its lifecycle, along with providing tech support where needed.</description>

      <description>Goal The goal of this project was to create an open source Android SDK to help customers access the API quickly and easily.
Implementation For Speech Recognition the SDK uses the Android system to record WAV audio, converts it to Speex, and streams that audio to the server in real time for recognition.
For Text to Speech the SDK accesses iSpeech&amp;rsquo;s REST api and streams the audio.
Completed The SDK accomplishes the stated goals and is being maintained.</description>

      <description>Goal DataStoreLib.py is a python SDK designed to access the DataStore API.
Implementation DataStoreLib.py simplifies the DataStore API into two python functions
#file: file to be passed to requests #mimeType: string mimeType #data: dictionary of metadata for the file DataStore.uploadFile(file, mimeType, data) #returns: True or False #conditions: array of conditions to pass to DataStore. # Syntax in the DataStore documentation DataStore.getIds(conditions) #returns: array of urls to files passing the conditions  Completed  Uploading Files Searching Metadata  Future goals None yet</description>
