      <description>Goal This SDK is designed to enable developers to interact with the Voice Recognition iSpeech API using Javascript.
Implementation The SDK uses getUserMedia() to record audio from the browser, encodes it to speex, then streams the data to the iSpeech API using a WebSocket.
Completed This project completed the stated goals.
My contribution I developed and maintained this project through its lifecycle, along with providing tech support where needed.</description>
